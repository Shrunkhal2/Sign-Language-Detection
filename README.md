Sign Language Detection System

This repository contains scripts to implement a Sign Language Detection System using machine learning. The project includes tools for:
	•	Data Collection: Capture images for sign language gestures.
	•	Dataset Creation: Prepare structured datasets for training models.
	•	Model Training: Train classifiers to recognize gestures.
	•	Real-Time Inference: Detect sign language gestures in real-time.

Features
	1.	Data Collection:
	•	Capture sign language gestures using a webcam.
	•	Save images organized by gesture labels for training.
	2.	Dataset Creation:
	•	Structure collected images into a format ready for training.
	•	Organize data into training, validation, and test sets.
	3.	Model Training:
	•	Train machine learning models to classify gestures.
	•	Supports TensorFlow/Keras models with configurable parameters.
	4.	Real-Time Gesture Detection:
	•	Use the trained model for real-time sign language recognition.
	•	Provides visual feedback and gesture detection confidence.
